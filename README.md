This report summarizes an image classification project focused on recognizing handwritten digits. It details the process of building, comparing, and refining neural network models using the MNIST dataset.

Problem & Dataset üìù
The core problem is to accurately classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning.

Training Data: 60,000 images of 28x28 pixels.

Testing Data: 10,000 images of 28x28 pixels.

Before training, the pixel values of the images were normalized to a range between 0 and 1 for better model performance.
