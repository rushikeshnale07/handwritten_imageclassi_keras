Of course, here is a summary report in README format.Handwritten Digit Classification with Neural Networks MNISTThis report summarizes an image classification project focused on recognizing handwritten digits. It details the process of building, comparing, and refining neural network models using the MNIST dataset.Problem & Dataset üìùThe core problem is to accurately classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning.Training Data: 60,000 images of 28x28 pixels.Testing Data: 10,000 images of 28x28 pixels.Before training, the pixel values of the images were normalized to a range between 0 and 1 for better model performance.Models & Methodology üß†Two primary neural network architectures were implemented and compared:Simple Neural Network (ANN): A basic, fully-connected network with one hidden layer. This model serves as a performance baseline.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A more advanced architecture designed for image data. It includes a convolutional layer for feature extraction and a max-pooling layer to reduce dimensionality.To enhance the performance of the baseline CNN, two key techniques were employed:Data Augmentation: The training dataset was artificially expanded by applying random rotations, shifts, and zooms to the images. This helps the model generalize better to new, unseen data.Hyperparameter Tuning: Using the Keras Tuner library, an automated search was conducted to find the optimal combination of parameters (like the number of filters and learning rate) for the CNN architecture.Results & Conclusion üìàThe performance of each model was evaluated based on its accuracy on the test dataset. The results clearly show the advantage of using a CNN and optimization techniques.ModelTest AccuracySimple ANN~97.6%Baseline CNN~98.6%Tuned CNN~99.2%The Convolutional Neural Network significantly outperformed the simple ANN. The application of data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning further improved the CNN's accuracy, resulting in a highly effective model for handwritten digit classification. The final model's high accuracy was confirmed by analyzing its confusion matrix, which showed very few misclassifications.
